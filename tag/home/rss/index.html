<p>So you’re ready to get Ghost live? Excellent!</p>

<p>The first decision you need to make, is whether you want to install and setup Ghost yourself, or whether you prefer to use an installer.</p>

<p>Installers</p>

<p>There are a couple of options for simple installers at the moment:</p>

<p>Deploy to the cloud with Bitnami. <br />
Launch Ghost with Rackspace deployments. <br />
Get up and running with a DigitalOcean Droplet. <br />
Manual Setup</p>

<p>You’re going to need a hosting package that already has, or will allow you to install Node.js. This means something like a cloud (Amazon EC2, DigitalOcean, Rackspace Cloud), VPS (Webfaction, Dreamhost) or other package that has SSH (terminal) access &amp; will allow you to install Node.js. There are plenty around and they can be very cheap.</p>

<p>What won’t work at the moment, is cPanel-style shared hosting as this is usually aimed specifically at hosting PHP. Although some offer Ruby, and so may offer Node.js in the future as they are somewhat similar.</p>]]></description><link>http://127.0.0.1:2368/this-is-a-test-post/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">a6f85d05-fa53-441a-a0b6-f1fa1ab4291a</guid><category><![CDATA[home]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[avipar]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2014 19:04:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
